abstract = {With the growth of the Internet, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) try to meet the increasing traffic demand with new technology and improved utilization of existing resources. Routing of data packets can affect network utilization. Packets are sent along network paths from source to destination following a protocol. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is the most commonly used intra-domain Internet routing protocol (IRP). Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes with several outgoing links on a shortest path to the destination IP address. Link weights are assigned by the network operator. A path length is the sum of the weights of the links in the path. The OSPF weight setting (OSPFWS) problem seeks a set of weights that optimizes network performance. We study the problem of optimizing OSPF weights, given a set of projected demands, with the objective of minimizing network congestion. The weight assignment problem is NP-hard. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the OSPFWS problem. We compare our results with the best known and commonly used heuristics for OSPF weight setting, as well as with a lower bound of the optimal multi-commodity flow routing, which is a linear programming relaxation of the OSPFWS problem. Computational experiments are made on the AT{\&}T Worldnet backbone with projected demands, and on twelve instances of synthetic networks.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {Open shortest path first (OSPF) is the most commonly used intra-domain Internet routing protocol. Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to the destination. The weights of the links, and thereby the shortest path routes, can be changed by the network operator. The weights could be set proportional to their physical distances, but often the main goal is to avoid congestion, i.e., overloading of links, and the standard heuristic recommended by Cisco is to make the weight of a link inversely proportional to its capacity. Our starting point was a proposed AT{\&}amp;T WorldNet backbone with demands projected from previous measurements. The desire was to optimize the weight setting based on the projected demands. We showed that optimizing the weight settings for a given set of demands is NP-hard, so we resorted to a local search heuristic. Surprisingly it turned out that for the proposed AT{\&}amp;T WorldNet backbone, we found weight settings that performed within a few percent from that of the optimal general routing where the flow for each demand is optimally distributed over all paths between source and destination. This contrasts the common belief that OSPF routing leads to congestion and it shows that for the network and demand matrix studied we cannot get a substantially better load balancing by switching to the proposed more flexible multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technologies. Our techniques were also tested on synthetic internetworks, based on a model of Zegura et al., (1996), for which we did not always get quite as close to the optimal general routing},

abstract = {The widespread use of the Internet proposes great challenges for information security. Routing protocols are used to distribute network topology information among routers. Routers find the best route according to the topology information, and realize the network data forwarding. Without correct router information, the network packet transmission is inefficient or incorrect, which may even cause network paralyzed. Therefore, secure routing protocol is an import factor to ensure network security. This paper emphasizes the security of OSPF routing protocol. We firstly outline the background of OSPF technology, and present the OSPF security analysis, including authentication mechanism, reliable flooding mechanism and hierarchical routing mechanism. Then the vulnerabilities of OSPF and protecting methods are introduced. In addition, we propose the attacks detection system of OSPF routing protocol from the perspective of the OSPF security, in order to detect attacks without affecting the network operation. Lastly, future research on OSPF routing protocol are concluded.},

abstract = {Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is one of the most widely used intra-domain routing protocol. It is well known that OSPF protocol does not provide flexibility in terms of packet forwarding to achieve any network optimization objective. Because of the high cost of network assets and commercial and competitive nature of Internet service provisioning, service providers are interested in performance optimization of their networks. This helps in reducing congestion hotspots and improving resource utilization across the network, which, in turn, results in an increased revenue collection. One way of achieving this is through Traffic Engineering. Currently traffic engineering is mostly done by using MPLS. But legacy networks running OSPF would need to be upgraded to MPLS. To achieve better resource utilization without upgrading OSPF network to MPLS is a challenge. In this paper we present a simple but effective algorithm, called Smart OSPF (S-OSPF) to provide traffic engineering solution in an OSPF based best effort network. We formulate an optimization problem based on the traffic demand to minimize the maximum link utilization in the network. Routing of the traffic demand is achieved using OSPF. We have simulated S-OSPF on real networks of two service providers. Simulation results show that S- OSPF based traffic engineering solution performance very closely follows the optimal solution.},

abstract = {The wide spread of smart phone causes the traffic demand in communication network increase rapidly. To address this increasing traffic, it should find appropriate routing to avoid link congestion. This allows effective resource utilization and improves network throughput in. Mishra et al. presented smart-open shortest path fast (S-OSPF) which is an extended scheme of conventional OSPF. This scheme aims to decrease congestion ratio by distributing traffic at only edge nodes. Intermediate nodes have the same functions as the conventional OSPF. S-OSPF achieves lower network congestion ratio compared to the conventional OSPF. In the other hand, it is difficult to add the extended S-OSPF functions to existing routers. In order to overcome the issue, we focus on the software-defined networking (SDN) technique. All routers are replaced in the SDN network with SDN switches, which have only data transfer function as a data plane, and these switches are controlled by a SDN controller. We are able to add extended functions for the switches. In S-OSPF, only edge nodes need to be replaced by SDN switches when other nodes obey conventional OSPF routing. The only edge nodes distribute the traffic incoming to the OSPF network from other networks, and other nodes operate OSPF routing. This technique can decrease network congestion ratio. According to the above reason, we propose hybrid software-defined networking (H-SDN). The concept of H-SDN is that to implement SDN system with conventional network system together. Here, in order to implement distributing traffic function on edge nodes in S-OSPF, we use H-SDN.},

abstract = { Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a popular protocol for routing within an autonomous system (AS) domain. In order to scale for large networks containing hundreds and thousands of subnets, OSPF supports a two-level hierarchical routing scheme through the use of OSPF areas. Subnet addresses within an area are aggregated, and this aggregation is a crucial requirement for scaling OSPF to large AS domains, as it results in significant reductions in routing table sizes, smaller link-state databases, and less network traffic to synchronize the router link-state databases. On the other hand, address aggregation also implies loss of information about the length of the shortest path to each subnet, which in turn, can lead to suboptimal routing. We address the important practical problem of configuring OSPF aggregates to minimize the error in OSPF shortest-path computations due to subnet aggregation. We first develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that, given an upper bound k on the number of aggregates to be advertised and a weight assignment function for the aggregates, computes the k aggregates that result in the minimum cumulative error in the shortest-path computations for all source-destination subnet pairs. Subsequently, we tackle the problem of assigning weights to OSPF aggregates such that the cumulative error in the computed shortest paths is minimized. We demonstrate that, while for certain special cases (e.g., unweighted cumulative error) efficient optimal algorithms for the weight assignment problem can be devised, the general problem itself is NP-hard. Consequently, we have to rely on search heuristics to solve the weight assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the algorithmic issues underlying the configuration of OSPF aggregates and to propose efficient configuration algorithms that are provably optimal for many practical scenarios.},

abstract = {With the current growth rate that networks are witnessing, it is essential to have routing protocols that can adjust to scale with this growth. OSPF (open shortest path first), the most widely used interior gateway protocol, needs to be adaptive enough to accommodate rapid changes to the complex nature of the Internet and other ISP networks. We present extensions to OSPF and OSPF-TE (OSPF with traffic engineering) that can be used to optimize such protocols for large scale MPLS networks. OSPF-TE specifies methods of adding traffic engineering capabilities to OSPF. The extensions to OSPF are designed to be as generic as possible while trying to address several issues related to the empowerment of IP networks with MPLS. This work shows how link state advertisements in OSPF, with a slight modification, can be utilized to load balance both control traffic and label switched paths in networks with parallel links and equal cost multipaths. In addition, we show how further optimization can be achieved for parallel links to reduce the size of the OSPF link state database and thus reduce CPU consumption},

Usability is when a user utilizes the system's functions easily, properly and clearly. Functionality and usability may vary from one system to another.

abstract = {There has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human-computer barrier. Hand gesture recognition is considered as an interaction technique having potential to communicate with machines. Human computer interaction (HCI) was never an easy task and lots of approaches are available to build such systems. Hand gesture recognition (HGR) using wearable data glove provides a solution to build a HCI system, but lags in terms of its computational time and poor interface. Pattern matching is one more solution which uses vision based techniques and provides strong interface to build HCI systems. But again, it requires complex algorithms which takes lots of computational time and hence limits its use in real time HCI applications. In this paper, we presented an eccentric approach for hand gesture recognition which is simple, fast and user independent and can be used to develop real time HCI applications. Based on proposed algorithm we built a system for Indian Sign Language recognition which converts Indian Sign numbers into text. The algorithm first captures the image of single handed gesture of speech/hearing impaired person using simple webcam and then using our proposed algorithm it classifies the gesture into its appropriate class. It uses simple logical conditions for gesture classification which make its use in real time HCI applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Poor nutrition and a lack of exercise have led to a situation where obesity is rapidly on the rise. As a result, mobile health interventions in the area of nutrition have been a great asset into changing the lives of many through the use of their devices. Smartphones and other mobile devices can be transformed into effective nutrition tracking tools that consumers can easily make use of to help improve their lives and wellbeing. The academic community has conducted a vast amount of research in the area of mobile nutrition however a number of challenges still exist in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI). HCI has been found to be a key contributing factor when developing systems that constantly and directly interact with their respective users. Effective HCI is required to bridge the communication barrier between a user and the device, thus ensuring a seam-less approach. This research paper highlights the efforts done by academics in the area of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape. Every study will be discussed in detailed by highlighted the key benefits together with a number of challenges that still exist. As a result, this review of literature will identify key lacunae that still exist in the field of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel software framework for the development and research in the area of multimodal human-computer interface (MHCI) systems. The proposed software framework, which is called the HCI∧2 Framework, is built upon publish/subscribe (P/S) architecture. It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of bridging modules, the HCI∧2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI∧2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI∧2 Framework's capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software. We also present an example of a full system developed using the proposed HCI∧2 Framework, which is called the CamGame system and represents a computer game based on hand-held marker(s) and low-cost camera(s).},

The protocol allows a group of cooperating real-time processes to establish a consistent view of each other's operational status, i.e. working correctly or not. The aim is to provide an application independent membership service in systems where several distributed real-time tasks share processing nodes. We assume that each such task consists of several processes executing on different nodes and that each node can execute processes belonging to different tasks. The protocol is applicable to any application domain, but has been developed for automotive active safety systems. Here, typical distributed real-time tasks include anti-lock braking, stability control and collision mitigation. In such systems, a membership service provides invaluable support for implementing fault-tolerance and graceful degradation.},

abstract = {Pervasive systems are composed of a large variety of networked smart devices that supposedly enrich the environment they are deployed in. The access to services provided by a pervasive system should be as natural and "unconscious" as possible. In a large number of cases, the available interaction modality seems to be more oriented towards showing off technological wonders rather than to the actual usability of the interface. In this paper we evaluate and compare two different versions of an information provision system deployed in two editions of a large fair. In particular, we will focus on the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Mediated-Communication (CMC) points of view. The analysis of such case studies is essential to understand the social dynamics of groups of people remotely interacting. One can thus talk about social ergonomics, which together with cognitive ergonomics, sketch these contexts from a perspective of individual usability. This is characterized by rules and guidelines for an accurate design of the communication environments. Such discussions aim at the optimization of the interaction process in accordance with the goals of the information system, in terms of interfaces, user satisfaction, performance and efficiency produced by the correct CMC. The comparison we propose will allows us to infer some important conclusion that can be useful to anyone who want to develop and deploy similar systems within similar events.},

A higher-order process consists of components, which are (sub-)processes themselves. The behaviour of a process results from the behaviour of its components and their interaction. While processes at the lowest level describe the essential units of a system, higher-level processes focus on the way their components interact and produce a new kind of behaviour. Such a behaviour can roughly be characterized as 'more planned'. We further propose a convenient specification formalism for higher-order processes based on partial equations.},

abstract = {The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3D model of the human hand or an image appearance model of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient “purposive” approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI. We discuss directions of future research in gesture recognition, including its integration with other natural modes of human-computer interaction},

abstract = {This paper proposes a protocol proxy scheme that can emulate the open shortest path first (OSPF) protocol in an effective and flexible manner. It is implemented in our developed network emulator, which is used to test network controllers for IP optical network management. In the protocol scheme, OSPF protocol emulation is achieved by combining an OSPF protocol proxy (introduced here) and an OSPF peer state manager based on existing OSPF protocol software. The protocol proxy produces OSPF packets holding link state advertisements with customized extensions including MPLS and GMPLS, while the OSPF peer state manager implements neighbor establishment via the proxy. The protocol proxy has two main functions: rewrite OSPF packets originated by the OSPF peer state manager and generate OSPF packets to inform the updated topology to the network controller. To implement the customized OSPF extensions, only the protocol proxy software need be modified; the existing OSPF software for the OPSF peer state manager is not touched. This makes the implementation of the OSPF emulation easy and flexible. Furthermore, the protocol proxy obtains the network topology information from the resource simulator, which is managed in a centralized manner. This reduces the amount of processing resources required and is scalable in terms of network size. We develop a prototype of the network emulator including OSPF protocol emulation with the protocol proxy scheme. The effectiveness of the protocol proxy scheme is confirmed by an experiment on 40 nodes.},

There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry. One outcome of this discussion is that it is important to view the design and evaluation problem from the robot's perspective as well as that of the human. Taken as a whole, this paper provides a framework with which to design and evaluate sociable robots from a HRI perspective.},

abstract = {Recently, extensive studies on human faces in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field reveal significant potentials for designing automatic age estimation systems via face image analysis. The success of such research may bring in many innovative HCI tools used for the applications of human-centered multimedia communication. Due to the temporal property of age progression, face images with aging features may display some sequential patterns with low-dimensional distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate that such aging patterns can be effectively extracted from a discriminant subspace learning algorithm and visualized as distinct manifold structures. Through the manifold method of analysis on face images, the dimensionality redundancy of the original image space can be significantly reduced with subspace learning. A multiple linear regression procedure, especially with a quadratic model function, can be facilitated by the low dimensionality to represent the manifold space embodying the discriminative property. Such a processing has been evaluated by extensive simulations and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on a large size aging database demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.},

We use a ¿backdrive¿ concept, in which one ROSC drives the voltage transitions in both structures during stress, such that the driving oscillator ages due to both BTI and HCI, while the other suffers from only BTI. In addition, long term or high voltage experiments facilitate TDDB measurements in both oscillators. Sub-¿s measurements are controlled by on-chip logic in order to avoid excessive unwanted BTI recovery during stress interruptions. Sub-ps frequency resolution is achieved during these short measurements using a beat frequency detection system, and we automate the experiments through a simple digital interface.

Holes (from inversion layer for pMOSFET NBTI, from channel due to impact ionization, and from gate poly due to anode-hole injection or valence-band hole tunneling for nMOSFET HCI) break equivSi-H bonds, whose time evolution is governed by either one-dimensional (NBTI or FN) or two-dimensional (HCI) reaction-diffusion models. Hot holes break equivSi-O bonds during both FN and HCI stress. Power-law time exponent of NIT during stress and recovery of NIT after stress are governed by relative contribution of broken equivSi-H and equivSi-O bonds (determined by cold- and hot-hole densities) and have important implications for lifetime prediction under NBTI, FN, and HCI stress conditions},

abstract = {The ability to recognize affective states of a person we are com- municating with is the core of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligenceisafacetofhumanintelligencethathasbeenarguedtobe indispensable and perhaps the most important for successful inter- personal social interaction. This paper argues that next-generation human–computer interaction (HCI) designs need to include the essence of emotional intelligence—the ability to recognize a user's affective states—in order to become more human-like, more effec- tive, and more efficient. Affective arousal modulates all nonverbal communicative cues (facial expressions, bodymovements, and vocal and physiological reactions). In a face-to-face interaction, humans detect and interpret those interactive signals of their communicator with little or no effort. Yet design and development of an automated system that accomplishes these tasks is rather difficult. This paper surveys the past work in solving these problems by a computer and provides a set of recommendations for developing the first part of an intelligent multimodal HCI—an automatic personalized analyzer of a user's nonverbal affective feedback.

abstract = {Recent advances in various signal-processing technologies, coupled with an explosion in the available computing power, have given rise to a number of novel human-computer interaction (HCI) modalities - speech, vision-based gesture recognition, eye tracking, electroencephalograph, etc. Successful embodiment of these modalities into an interface has the potential of easing the HCI bottleneck that has become noticeable with the advances in computing and communication. It has also become increasingly evident that the difficulties encountered in the analysis and interpretation of individual sensing modalities may be overcome by integrating them into a multimodal human-computer interface. In this paper, we examine several promising directions toward achieving multimodal HCI. We consider some of the emerging novel input modalities for HCI and the fundamental issues in integrating them at various levels - from early `signal' level to intermediate `feature' level to late `decision' level. We discuss the different computational approaches that may be applied at the different levels of modality integration. We also briefly review several demonstrated multimodal HCI systems and applications. Despite all the recent developments, it is clear that further research is needed for interpreting and fusing multiple sensing modalities in the context of HCl. This research can benefit from many disparate fields of study that increase our understanding of the different human communication modalities and their potential role in HCI.},

The first of these involves a rapid increase in early failures due to a distribution of activation energies of defect precursors. We show that the slopes of the failure functions for hot carrier interface state generation (HCI) and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) have simple physical interpretations in terms of a geometrical factor and the activation energy distribution width. The second issue involves a transition from single to multiple electrons causing individual defects. This picture allows simple physical explanations for the larger HCI damage in NMOS versus PMOS, the anomalous isotope effect of activation energies for HCI in the lucky electron model, and the observed power law dependence of the time to breakdown versus voltage for TDDB for ultrathin oxides.},

abstract = {The recently developed depth sensors, e.g., the Kinect sensor, have provided new opportunities for human-computer interaction (HCI). Although great progress has been made by leveraging the Kinect sensor, e.g., in human body tracking, face recognition and human action recognition, robust hand gesture recognition remains an open problem. Compared to the entire human body, the hand is a smaller object with more complex articulations and more easily affected by segmentation errors. It is thus a very challenging problem to recognize hand gestures. This paper focuses on building a robust part-based hand gesture recognition system using Kinect sensor. To handle the noisy hand shapes obtained from the Kinect sensor, we propose a novel distance metric, Finger-EarthMover's Distance (FEMD), to measure the dissimilarity between hand shapes. As it only matches the finger parts while not the whole hand, it can better distinguish the hand gestures of slight differences. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our hand gesture recognition system is accurate (a 93.2{\%} mean accuracy on a challenging 10-gesture dataset), efficient (average 0.0750 s per frame), robust to hand articulations, distortions and orientation or scale changes, and can work in uncontrolled environments (cluttered backgrounds and lighting conditions). The superiority of our system is further demonstrated in two real-life HCI applications.},

abstract = {Accurate performance-degradation monitoring of nanometer MOSFET digital circuits is one of the most critical issues in adaptive design techniques for overcoming the performance degradation due to aging phenomena such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI). Therefore, this paper proposes new on-chip aging sensor circuits which deploy a threshold voltage detector for monitoring the performance degradation of an aged MOSFET. The new aging sensor circuits measure the threshold voltage difference between a NBTI/HCI stressed MOSFET device and a NBTI/HCI unstressed MOSFET device using an inverter chain and a phase comparator and digitalize the phase difference induced by the threshold voltage difference. The proposed sensor circuits achieve a direct correlation between the threshold voltage degradation and the phase difference (a phase difference resolution of 1 ns per 0.01 V threshold voltage shift). Also, the circuits are almost independent of temperature variation due to symmetrical circuit structures. A 45 nm CMOS technology and predictive NBTI/HCI models have been used to implement and evaluate the proposed circuits. The implemented layout size is 18.58 x 7.97 $\mu$m2; the post-layout power consumption is 18.57 $\mu$W during NBTI/HCI stress mode and 30.86 $\mu$W during NBTI/HCI measurement mode on average.},

In this paper HCI command to control electric-powered wheelchair is made of combinations of left-, right-and both-shoulders elevation gestures. The proposed wearable HCI hardware consists of two active surface electrodes, a high-speed micro-controller, a Bluetooth module, and a battery. Experimental results using the wearable EMG based HCI and the electric-powered wheelchair developed show the proposed wearable EMG-based HCI is feasible for the users with severe motor disabilities. },

abstract = {This paper describes technology and tools for intelligent human-computer interaction (IHCI) in which human cognitive, perceptual, motor and affective factors are modeled and used to adapt the H-C interface. IHCI emphasizes that human behavior encompasses both apparent human behavior and the hidden mental state behind behavioral performance. IHCI expands on the interpretation of human activities, known as W4 (what, where, when, who). While W4 only addresses the apparent perceptual aspect of human behavior the W5+ technology for IHCI described in this paper addresses also the why and how questions, whose solution requires recognizing specific cognitive states. IHCI integrates parsing and interpretation of nonverbal information with a computational cognitive model of the user which, in turn, feeds into processes that adapt the interface to enhance operator performance and provide for rational decision-making. The technology proposed is based on a general four-stage interactive framework, which moves from parsing the raw sensory-motor input, to interpreting the user's motions and emotions, to building an understanding of the user's current cognitive state. It then diagnoses various problems in the situation and adapts the interface appropriately. The interactive component of the system improves processing at each stage. Examples of perceptual, behavioral, and cognitive tools are described throughout the paper Adaptive and intelligent HCI are important for novel applications of computing, including ubiquitous and human-centered computing.},

Currently, the only technology that satisfies the advanced requirements of hand-based input for HCI is glovebased sensing. This technology, however, has several drawbacks including that it hinders the ease and naturalness with which the user can interact with the computer controlled environment, and it requires long calibration and setup procedures. Computer vision has the potential to provide much more natural, non-contact solutions. As a result, there have been considerable research efforts to use the hand as an input device for HCI. A very challenging problem in this context, which is the focus of this review, is recovering the 3D pose of the hand and the fingers as glove-based devices do. This paper presents a brief literature review on full degreeof- freedom (DOF) hand motion estimation methods.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, wearable computing has emerged as the perfect tool for embodying humanistic intelligence (HI). HI is intelligence that arises when a human is part of the feedback loop of a computational process in which the human and computer are inextricably intertwined. It is common in the field of human-computer interaction to think of the human and computer as separate entities. (indeed, the term "HCI" emphasizes this separateness by treating the human and computer as different entities that interact.) However, in HI theory, we prefer not to think of the wearer and the computer with its associated I/O apparatus as separate entities. Instead, we regard the computer as a second brain and its sensory modalities as additional senses, in which synthetic synesthesia merges with the wearer's senses. When a wearable computer functions in a successful embodiment of HI, the computer uses the human's mind and body as one of its peripherals, just as the human uses the computer as a peripheral. This reciprocal relationship is at the heart of HI.},

Robust multi-cue hand tracking is then achieved by velocity-weighted features and color cue.

We commonly use expert reviews to assess interface usability. Expert reviews can generate valuable feedback on visualization tools. We recommend i) including experts with experience in data display as well as usability, and ii) developing heuristics based on visualization guidelines as well as usability guidelines. Expert reviews should not be used exclusively, since experts might not hilly predict end-user actions. Furthermore, we encourage more experimentation with this technique, particularly to develop a good set of visualization heuristics and to compare it with other methods.},

Marker systems typically have two stages, hypothesis generation from unique image features and verification/identification. A set of criteria for high robustness and practical use are identified and then optimized to produce the ARTag fiducial marker system. An edge-based method robust to lighting and partial occlusion is used for the hypothesis stage, and a reliable digital coding system is used for the identification and verification stage.

Its intuitiveness and naturalness have spawned many applications in exploring large and complex data, computer games, virtual reality, health care, etc. Although the market for hand gesture based HCI is huge, building a robust hand gesture recognition system remains a challenging problem for traditional vision-based approaches, which are greatly limited by the quality of the input from optical sensors. [16] proposed a novel dissimilarity distance metric for hand gesture recognition using Kinect sensor, called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD). In this paper, we compare the performance in terms of speed and accuracy between FEMD and traditional corresponding-based shape matching algorithm, Shape Context. And then we introduce several HCI applications built on top of a accurate and robust hand gesture recognition system based on FEMD. This hand gesture recognition system performs robustly despite variations in hand orientation, scale or articulation. Moreover, it works well in uncontrolled environments with background clusters. We demonstrate that this robust hand gesture recognition system can be a key enabler for numerous hand gesture based HCI systems.},

abstract = {The impact of hot-carrier injection (HCI) due to repetitive unclamped inductive switching (UIS) on the electrical performance of low-voltage trench power n-type MOSFETs (nMOSFETs) is assessed. Trench power nMOSFETs with 20- and 30-V breakdown voltage ratings in TO-220 packages have been fabricated and subjected to over 100 million cycles of repetitive UIS with different avalanche currents I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}AV{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} at a mounting base temperature T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}MB{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 150{\&}{\#}x00B0;C. Impact ionization during avalanche conduction in the channel causes hot-hole injection into the gate dielectric, which results in a reduction of the threshold voltage V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GSTX{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, as the number of avalanche cycles N increases. The experimental data reveal a power-law relationship between the change in the threshold voltage {\&}{\#}x0394;V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GSTX{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and N. The results show that the power-law prefactor is directly proportional to the avalanche current. After 100 million cycles, it was observed in the 20-V rated MOSFETs that the power-law prefactor increased by 30{\%} when I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}AV{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was increased from 160 to 225 A, thereby approximating a linear relationship. A stable subthreshold slope with avalanche cycling indicates that interface trap generation may not be an active degradation mechanism. The impact of the cell pitch on avalanche ruggedness is also investigated by testing 2.5- and 4- m cell-pitch 30-V rated MOSFETs. Measurements showed that the power-law prefactor reduced by 40{\%} when the cell pitch was reduced by 37.5{\%}. The improved V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GSTX{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} stability with the smaller cell-pitch MOSFETs is attributed to a lower avalanche current per unit cell resulting in less hot-hole injection and, hence, smaller V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GSTX{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} shift. The 2.5-m cell-pitch MOSFETs also show 25{\%} improved on -state resistance R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DSON{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, better R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DSON{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} stability, and 20{\%} less subthreshold slope compared with the 4-m cell-pitch MOSFETs, although with 100{\%} higher initial I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DSS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and less I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DSS{\textless}/s-$\backslash$n-$\backslash$nub{\textgreater} stability with avalanche cycling. These results are important for manufacturers of automotive MOSFETs where multiple avalanche occurrences over the lifetime of the MOSFET are expected.},

The proposed classification model is formed according to the current neuroscience trends, since it adopts the independency of two emotional dimensions, namely arousal and valence, as dictated by the bidirectional emotion theory, whereas it is gender-specific. A two-step classification procedure is proposed for the discrimination of emotional states between EEG signals evoked by pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, which also vary in their arousal/intensity levels. The first classification level involves the arousal discrimination. The valence discrimination is then performed. The Mahalanobis (MD) distance-based classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) were used for the discrimination of emotions. The achieved overall classification rates were 79.5{\%} and 81.3{\%} for the MD and SVM, respectively, significantly higher than in previous studies. The robust classification of objective emotional measures is the first step toward numerous applications within the sphere of human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering is a creative process in which stakeholders work together to create ideas for new software systems that are eventually expressed as requirements. This paper reports a workshop that integrated creativity techniques with different types of use case and system context modeling to discover stakeholder requirements for EASM, a future air space management software system to enable the more effective, longer-term planning of UK and European airspace use. The workshop was successful in that it provided a range of outputs that were later assessed for their novelty and usefulness in the final specification of the EASM software. The paper describes the workshop structure, gives examples of outputs from it, and uses these results to answer 2 research questions about the utility of creativity techniques and workshops that had not been answered in previous research.},

In this paper, we present an eye$\backslash$ngaze tracking system based on a robust low-cost real-time pupil$\backslash$ndetector, and we describe some eye-aware applications that are being$\backslash$ndeveloped to enhance HCI. Images of pupils are segmented using an active$\backslash$nlighting scheme that exploits very particular properties of eyes. Once$\backslash$nthe pupil is detected, its center is tracked, along with the corneal$\backslash$nreflection (CR) generated by the light sources. Assuming little head$\backslash$nmotion, the eye gaze direction is computed based on the vector between$\backslash$nthe centers of the CR and the pupil, after a brief calibration$\backslash$nprocedure. Other information, such as pupil size and blink rate, can$\backslash$nalso be made available.

abstract = { Incorporating the well-known Unified Modeling Language into a generic modeling framework makes research on multimodal human-computer interaction accessible to a wide range off software engineers. Multimodal interaction is part of everyday human discourse: We speak, move, gesture, and shift our gaze in an effective flow of communication. Recent initiatives such as perceptual and attentive user interfaces put these natural human behaviors in the center of the human-computer interaction (HCI). We've designed a generic modeling framework for specifying multimodal HCI using the Object Management Group's Unified Modeling Language. Because it's a well-known and widely supported standard - computer science departments typically cover it in undergraduate courses, and many books, training courses, and tools support it - UML makes it easier for software engineers unfamiliar with multimodal research to apply HCI knowledge, resulting in broader and more practical effects. Standardization provides a significant driving force for further progress because it codifies best practices, enables and encourages reuse, and facilitates interworking between complementary tools.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present the design and application of an electrooculogram (EOG) based on an efficient human-computer interface (HCI). Establishing an alternative channel without speaking and hand movements is important in increasing the quality of life for the handicapped. EOG-based systems are more efficient than electroencephalogram (EEG)-based systems in some cases. By using a realized virtual keyboard, it is possible to notify in writing the needs of the patient in a relatively short time. Considering the biopotential measurement pitfalls, the novel EOG-based HCI system allows people to successfully communicate with their environment by using only eye movements. Classifying horizontal and vertical EOG channel signals in an efficient interface is realized in this study. The new system is microcontroller based, with a common-mode rejection ratio of 88 dB, an electronic noise of 0.6 {\&}{\#}x03BC;V (p-p), and a sampling rate of 176 Hz. The nearest neighborhood algorithm is used to classify the signals, and the classification performance is 95{\%}. The novel EOG-based HCI system allows people to successfully and economically communicate with their environment by using only eye movements.},
